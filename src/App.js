          Hi, my name is Nicholas and I am a fluent english speaker. I am currently 23 years old living in Los Angeles County, California. I have many 
          hobbies i love to surround myself with like video games, rock climbing and FPV Drone flying.
          I think one of my greatest ability is also one of my greatest weaknesses, I strive always to carry my weight in anything I do in life. 
          I have the same passion towards my coding. I'm 23 years old and I crave to learn new and different technologies everyday.
