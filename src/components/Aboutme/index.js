    <p>
      Hi, my name is Nicholas. I am currently 23 years old living in Los
      Angeles County, California. I have many hobbies i love to surround
      myself with like video games, rock climbing and FPV Drone flying. I
      think one of my greatest ability is also one of my greatest
      weaknesses, I strive always to carry my weight in anything I do in
      life. I have the same passion towards my coding. I'm 23 years old and
      I crave to learn new and different technologies everyday.
